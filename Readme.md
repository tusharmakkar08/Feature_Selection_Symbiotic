FEATURE SELECTION USING PAIRWISE SYMBIOTIC EVOLUTION
====================================================
In machine learning and statistics, feature selection, also known as variable selection, attribute
selection or variable subset selection, is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features for
use in model construction. The central assumption when using a feature selection technique is
that the data contains many redundant or irrelevant features. Redundant features are those which
provide no more information than the currently selected features, and irrelevant features provide
no useful information in any context. Thus finding a “compact” subset of non-redundant and
relevant features is an important machine learning problem.We are trying to improvise the
Feature Selection Algorithm by giving more relevant results in the copacetic time period using
pairwise symbiotic evolution.
